# FEE-Project-Team9
A tribute page is a webpage dedicated in honor of someone you love, admire, or respect.
Our goal is to develop and design an informative webpage to inspire and enlighten our readers.
We want to honor one of the biggest scientist i.e. Isaac newton.
Sir Isaac Newton  (25 December 1642 – 20 March 1727) was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, theologian, and author who was described in his time as a natural philosopher. He was a key figure in the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment that followed. His pioneering book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, consolidated many of his and others' previous results and established classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing infinitesimal calculus.
Our goal was to develop and design a webpage to honor and admire someone as a tribute to them . Along with that we also wanted to create an informative webpage to inspire our readers with his speech, his actions, and by his work so that one can know about this person and motivate themselves through this person.
	In future, we can provide service for the people who want to get their own tribute pages.
	We can also add a contact us page for further details and inquiries.
	Multiple card display can be converted to carousel.
